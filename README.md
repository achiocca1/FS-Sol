# FS-Sol

Closed form solution of critical plane factor of Fatemi-Socie in its general formulation. The algorithm works under the hypoteses of linear-elasticity and proportional loading.

- FSSol_v1.0 (it includes *Fatemi-Socie* critical plane factor)

The mathematical procedure is described in the article:
